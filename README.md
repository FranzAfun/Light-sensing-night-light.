# Light-Sensing Night Light

A simple Arduino project that mimics the logic of a street light.  
The LED automatically turns on when it's dark and turns off when it's bright.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 1 LED
- Resistors
- Jumper wires

## How It Works
The LDR reads the light level.  
If the light level is below the threshold, the LED turns on.  
If the light level is above the threshold, the LED turns off.
